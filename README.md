# catching-notifications

The app will run as a service in the background.

The app is originally intended to catch the notification coming from the third part apps to your devices.
The user can set the "color" to denote the particular app the notification came from.
Bluetooth stack was implemented to send the color coding to some other device which can then prominently
show the color to the user using other means.
